It's about as simple as you get for an Arduino project, a decent place to begin.\r\n\r\nThis project uses a tilt switch to control seven LEDs turning on and off in a linear chase.  The direction of the LEDs' chase will change depending on the state of the tilt switch.\r\n\r\n### The Circuit\r\nFirst, attach the anodes of seven LEDs to digital pins 2 through 8 of your Arduino. Put 220-ohm resistors in series with the LEDs, to connect them to ground.\r\n\r\nNExt, attach one side of a tilt switch to +5V.  Connect the other side of the switch to digital pin 10.  Attach a 10-kilohm resistor in series with the switch to ground.  The images below show you how it should look.\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like on a breadboard:\r\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/tigoe/ArduinoGeneralExamples/master/LedChaser/LedChaser_bb.png\" alt=\"The breadboard view of the circuit\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here's the schematic view:\r\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.github.com/tigoe/ArduinoGeneralExamples/master/LedChaser/LedChaser_schem.png\" alt\"The schematic view of the circuit\">\r\n\r\nThe code can be found in this repository.","name":"LED Chaser","google":""}
